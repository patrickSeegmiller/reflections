When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Any time you wish to share your work with others, or where you are collaborating with others on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may have things you wish to push before taking any information from a remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are basically clones on GitHub. Clones retrieve remote repositories. Branches allow different versions of projects.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows for people to work on the same material and still allow for conflict resolutions when the need arises.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier and what would be harder?

I would probably use lots and lots of email correspondence. This would obviously be more difficult as changes would necessarily be made on a far smaller scale, and with more human error.
