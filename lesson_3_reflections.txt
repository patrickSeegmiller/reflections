When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Any time you wish to share your work with others, or where you are collaborating with others on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may have things you wish to push before taking any information from a remote repository.
