What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates the .git file, which then makes the containing folder into a repository. This allows us to use all of the tools we have studied.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate state which can contain files you wish to commit to a respository. This is advantageous as it allows one a final check of whether a potential commit will be executed as desired.
